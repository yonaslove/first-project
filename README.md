The above code is a basic implementation of an online voting system using the Java programming language. 
The code defines a single class called “OnlineVotingSystem” and contains a single method called “main” 
which is the entry point of the program.At the beginning of the main method, the code creates 
two integer variables called “candidate1Votes” and “candidate2Votes” and initializes them to zero. 
These variables will be used to store the vote count for each candidate.Then, 
the code uses a Scanner object to read input from the user and prompts the user to enter their name and age.
The user’s age is then checked to see if they are eligible to vote (over 18 years old). If the user is eligible to vote, 
the code displays a list of candidates and prompts the user to select a candidate to vote for. 
The user’s selection is stored in the variable “userSelection”.
